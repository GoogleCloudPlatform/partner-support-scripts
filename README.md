# Google Cloud Platform Partner Scripts

The purpose of this repository is to give our Partners a central location where we can release scripts that will be useful to them.

# list-projects

This script will display a table of all projects and their assigned billing accounts. It will clearly show the following information:
- Billing Account
- Project ID
- Project Name
- Project #
- Parent Billing Account (if Billing Account is a sub account id)

It's important to note the script will run with the permissions of the executor of said script. Permissions to see project information and billing information are necessary.
